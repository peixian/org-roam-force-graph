* D3 Force Diagram from Org-Roam DB

Scripts to generate a json of nodes and links from ~org-roam.db~, and a basic html shim to display them.

** Example:
   https://wiki.space.af/graph.html
   [[file:./example.png]]

** Usage:

*** Prereq's
    You will need the ~networkx~ python library and the ~cdlib~ python libraries:
    - https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html
    - https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

    Both can be installed with ~pip install -r requirements.txt~.


*** Generating the JSON and Viewing
    By default running
    #+begin_src sh
      $> ./org-roam-d3.py && python3 -m http.server 9000
    #+end_src

    should generate a ~./org-data.json~ file in the current directory and start up a server. Open http://localhost:9000, and you should see your graph.

    By default this searches under ~$HOME/.emacs.d/org-roam.db~. If you store the database in another location, you can use the --org-db-location flag.

    The output location can be set with the ~--output~ flag. Note that the ~index.html~ file that is included with this repo is hardcoded to check for a file called ~org-data.json~ in the same directory, you will need to edit the HTML file if the output path is changed.

*** Additional Features
    ~org-roam-d3.py~ supports a few additional features, such as replacement to generate url links (if you host your notes on a webpage, for example).
#+begin_src sh
      $> ./org-roam-d3.py  --help
      usage: org-roam-d3.py [-h] [--org-db-location DB_LOCATION]
      [--output OUTPUT_LOCATION]
      [--replace REPLACEMENTS [REPLACEMENTS ...]]

      Generates a json file from your org-roam DB

      optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --org-db-location DB_LOCATION
      Location of org-roam.db file. Defaults to
      $HOME/.emacs.d/org-roam.db
      --output OUTPUT_LOCATION, -o OUTPUT_LOCATION
      File to output as. Defaults to './org-data.json'
      --replace REPLACEMENTS [REPLACEMENTS ...]
      Replacement to generate urls. Takes in <FILE_PATH>
      <REPLACEMENT_VALUE>
    #+end_src

** Limitations
   I have not tested this for:
   - org roam graphs without a central node
   - many other things

** License
   BSD 3 Clause. See the ~license~ file.
